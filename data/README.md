This directory is ignored by default in version control. For publication, do not include raw patient data.

Suggested contents for reproducible examples:
- Small synthetic or anonymized tiles (e.g., PNG format) demonstrating the pipeline.
- A minimal CSV (metadata.csv) with 2â€“3 example rows, with no PHI.

Placeholders:
- .gitkeep ensures the directory exists in the repo without data.
