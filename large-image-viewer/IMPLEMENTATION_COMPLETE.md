# âœ… COMPLETED: Enhanced Large Image Viewer - Performance & Usability Improvements

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented major performance and usability improvements to your large image viewer to address the laggy loading and missing tiling functionality. The viewer now includes accurate zooming and intuitive mouse-based region selection.

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Advanced Tiling System** âœ…
- **Background Tile Loading**: `TileLoader` class handles asynchronous tile loading
- **Smart Caching**: LRU-style tile cache with configurable size limits
- **Viewport-based Rendering**: Only loads visible tiles for optimal performance
- **Multi-level Zoom Support**: Automatically selects best zoom level
- **Priority Loading**: Tiles closer to viewport center load first

### 2. **Accurate Zooming & Navigation** âœ…
- **Zoom-to-Point**: Zoom in/out around mouse cursor position
- **Smooth Zoom Range**: Support from 1% to 10,000% zoom levels
- **Optimized Rendering**: Fast transformation for high zoom levels
- **Precise Coordinate Mapping**: Accurate widget â†” image coordinate conversion
- **Viewport Management**: Efficient tracking for large images

### 3. **Mouse-Based Region Selection** âœ…
- **Screenshot-style Selection**: Click and drag to select regions
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time selection rectangle with size display
- **Accurate Coordinates**: Precise mapping from screen to image coordinates
- **Toggle Mode**: Easy enable/disable via toolbar button
- **Rubber Band Selection**: Standard OS-style selection rectangle

### 4. **Enhanced User Interface** âœ…
- **Region Selection Button**: Toolbar toggle for selection mode
- **Live Coordinates**: Status bar shows current mouse position
- **Zoom Level Display**: Real-time zoom percentage
- **Visual Selection Info**: Size and position overlay during selection

## ðŸŽ® New Interactive Controls
