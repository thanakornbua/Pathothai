# Enhanced Large Image Viewer - Performance and Usability Improvements

## Overview
The large image viewer has been significantly enhanced to address performance issues and add intuitive region selection functionality. The main improvements focus on tiling support, accurate zooming, and mouse-based region selection.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Advanced Tiling System
- **Background Tile Loading**: Implemented `TileLoader` thread class for asynchronous tile loading
- **Intelligent Tile Caching**: Smart cache management with LRU-style eviction
- **Viewport-based Rendering**: Only loads and renders visible tiles for better performance
- **Multi-level Zoom Support**: Automatically selects optimal zoom level for current view
- **Priority-based Loading**: Tiles closer to viewport center load first

### 2. Accurate Zooming and Navigation
- **Zoom-to-Point**: Zoom in/out around mouse cursor position
- **Smooth Zoom Levels**: Support for zoom levels from 1% to 10000%
- **Optimized Rendering**: Uses fast transformation for high zoom levels
- **Viewport Management**: Efficient viewport tracking for large images
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Accurate conversion between widget and image coordinates

### 3. Intuitive Region Selection
- **Screenshot-style Selection**: Click and drag to select regions like taking a screenshot
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time selection rectangle with size display
- **Accurate Coordinates**: Precise mapping from screen to image coordinates
- **Toggle Mode**: Easy on/off toggle for selection mode
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ESC to cancel selection, arrow keys for pan

### 4. Enhanced User Interface
- **Region Selection Toggle**: Toolbar button to enable/disable selection mode
- **Live Coordinate Display**: Status bar shows current mouse position in image coordinates
- **Zoom Level Display**: Real-time zoom percentage in status bar
- **Visual Selection Feedback**: Semi-transparent overlay with size information

## New Features

### Mouse Interactions
- **Ctrl + Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out around cursor
- **Left Click + Drag**: Pan image (when not in selection mode)
- **Left Click + Drag**: Select region (when in selection mode)
- **Double Click**: Quick zoom in around click point
- **Ctrl + Double Click**: Fit to window
- **Right Click + Ctrl**: Reset pan to center

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **+ / =**: Zoom in
- **-**: Zoom out
- **0**: Reset to 100% zoom
- **F**: Fit to window
- **Arrow Keys**: Pan image
- **ESC**: Cancel selection or fit to window

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory-mapped File Access**: For very large files
- **Chunked Image Loading**: Prevents memory overflow
- **Tile-based Rendering**: Only renders visible portions
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking tile loading
- **Intelligent Caching**: Keeps frequently used tiles in memory

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### `TileLoader` (Background Thread)
- Manages asynchronous tile loading
- Priority-based request queue
- Thread-safe tile delivery

#### `ImageDisplayLabel` (Enhanced Canvas)
- Custom paint events for tiled rendering
- Viewport management and coordinate mapping
- Mouse and keyboard event handling
- Region selection with rubber band

#### `EnhancedLargeImageLoader` (Updated)
- Added `get_tile()` method for tile extraction
- Support for multiple zoom levels
- Optimized region extraction

### Integration Points
- **Main Window**: Updated to connect new signals and enable region selection
- **Image Canvas**: Enhanced with tiling support and selection overlay
- **Region Selector**: Connected to new selection system

## Usage Instructions

### Loading Large Images
1. Use File > Open or the Open button
2. The viewer automatically detects if tiling is beneficial
3. For WSI files, multiple zoom levels are automatically available

### Selecting Regions
1. Click the "Select Region" button in the toolbar
2. Click and drag on the image to select an area
3. The selected region coordinates are displayed
4. Click "Select Region" again to disable selection mode

### Navigation
- Use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to zoom around cursor
- Drag with left mouse button to pan
- Use keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation
- Double-click to zoom in on a specific area

## Performance Benefits
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Only loads visible tiles
- **Faster Loading**: Background tile loading prevents UI blocking
- **Smoother Zooming**: Optimized rendering for different zoom levels
- **Responsive Interface**: Non-blocking operations for large files

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-threaded tile loading for even better performance
- Advanced image processing filters
- Batch region extraction
- Region annotation and labeling
- Export to various formats with metadata

## Testing
Use the provided `test_enhanced_viewer.py` script to test the new functionality:
```bash
cd large-image-viewer
python test_enhanced_viewer.py
```

This creates a test image with patterns and allows testing of all new features including zooming, panning, and region selection.
